The modified version also converts the grade automatically to the new T.I.P. grading scheme, and the layout is also fixed for easier readability rather than having all text cramped together. Another difference is that the value error is also fixed, originally when you enter a character or anything that is not a valid number, a value error will show and stops the cell. But in this modified version it prompts you to re-enter a valid number instead."
